### Phase Two Challenge

You will have 3 hours to work on completing this challenge. There are estimated times on each part to help guide you with time management.

- Part One: Sinatra App (~ 2 hours)
- Part Two: OOJS (~ 45 minutes)

Be sure to commit early and often, but do **not** push your branch to Github until 12:15 PM.

Remember that we will be doing code reviews tomorrow to talk through your code. This is an opportunity to have a relaxed conversation regarding your code. If you struggle on one of the parts above, let us know! We want to make sure you're prepared for Phase Three.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ask questions. Spend a few minutes debugging on your own, but if you're stuck for more than 5 minutes - don't hesitate to ask questions. Three hours of suffering in silence, is three hours of wasted precious time here at DBC!

Good luck :)
